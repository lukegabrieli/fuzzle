        <h1>About Fuzzle</h1>
        <p>Fuzzle was created by two tennis fans who were tired of not being albe to actively engage with the Seattle tennis community. We asked ourselfs, "Why isn't there a site where you can go see all of the tennis courts in Seattle and where you can ask other tennis players to meet up?" Thus, Fuzzle was born.</p>
        <h1>People</h1>
        <p>With Fuzzle, you can create an account with your personal information, including your name, gender, location and your USTA NTRP rating score based on your level of play. From there, you can view other users' profiles and send them invitations to meet and play.</p>
        <a href="">Find People</a>
        <h1>Courts</h1>
        <p>If you're just looking to find a court near you, you can use Fuzzle's map feature, which conveniently displays all of the public tennis courts registered by the Seattle parks department.</p>
